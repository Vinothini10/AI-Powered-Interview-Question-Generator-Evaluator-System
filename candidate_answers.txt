# Candidate 1 – Hire
1. API Design: I designed and deployed RESTful APIs with full versioning (/v1/users), JSON request/response standards, OAuth2 authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and idempotency. All endpoints are covered by unit and integration tests, and successfully supported over 50,000 daily requests in production.

3. Cloud Deployment: I deployed Flask/FastAPI applications on AWS ECS/Fargate with CI/CD pipelines, automated scaling, monitoring with CloudWatch, and proper VPC/subnets and secrets management. All deployments passed load tests.
4. Debugging/Monitoring: I implemented structured logging, metrics dashboards, tracing, and alerting. Maintained incident runbooks and conducted postmortems to prevent recurrence.
5. Behavioral: I resolved a high-priority team conflict by mediating design disagreements, presenting data-driven decisions, and coordinating cross-functional teams to deliver on time and exceed performance expectations.
